### Development Log
`1/17/24`
This readme is in BETA so itll change soon. I startd working on v5 in React but i decided not too because it would be too... well... complicated. Using npm router and trying to route every game page and file would be a tough process so this regular html project is prbabaly going to be the alpha version until I rewrite it with another frameork for production. It most likely will be react but since I am very new and I still have to learn it, I will just use vinella html and css to at least get somehting. At some point in time I am planning to switcch to some node based framework so I can add maybe a live chat, kasm, or a proxy later down the line.
